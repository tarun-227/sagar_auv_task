This script is part of the Catkin build system used in ROS (Robot Operating System). It generates shell commands to set up or modify environment variables for a ROS workspace.

Key Responsibilities:
Parse command-line arguments to determine if it should extend or reset the environment.

Manipulate environment variables like PATH, PYTHONPATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, etc., to include or exclude paths related to ROS workspaces.

Add environment hooks (extra shell scripts for workspace setup) found in profile.d directories of Catkin workspaces.

Ensures cross-platform support (Linux/macOS/Windows).

Handles duplicate paths, non-existent paths, and proper ordering.
