# ROS Environment Setup Script (`setup.py`)

This Python script is typically used **internally by `catkin`** during the source setup (`source devel/setup.bash`) of a ROS workspace. It configures shell commands to properly set up environment variables so that ROS tools can function correctly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Functionalities

### 1. **Environment Variable Setup**

Defines and modifies variables like:

- `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`
- `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` / `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`
- `PATH`
- `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`
- `PYTHONPATH`

These variables tell the system where to look for compiled binaries, shared libraries, and Python modules related to ROS packages.

### 2. **Cross-Platform Support**

Supports:

- **Linux/Unix/macOS:** Uses standard Unix-like `export` syntax
- **Windows:** Uses `set` command syntax for environment variables

---

### 3. **Rollback Function**

Removes previously added paths in case the workspace environment is being **reset** (i.e., to avoid path pollution from older builds).

```python
rollback_env_variables(environ, ENV_VAR_SUBFOLDERS)
